## How to Use

1. Download the ZIP of this repository using the green button in the top right. The file `color_picker.rpy` is require; the file `color_picker_examples.rpy` is optional but will show you possible ways to use the tool.
2. Put `color_picker.rpy` inside your Ren'Py project folder (with your other `rpy` files).
3. There is a test label, `label how_to_use_color_picker`, included in `color_picker.rpy`. You can jump to it to test out the color picker (e.g. `jump how_to_use_color_picker`).

In particular, the example screen `screen color_picker` should be used as a guide for adding the picker to your own screens. The picker, hue bars, preview swatch, hex code information, etc. are all separate screen elements and can be resized and moved around the screen however you like.
